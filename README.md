Test - sending user_id or email to back end
Store last 10 stocks to that user
User logout 
User log back in
Data persist and displays

Questions?
Whatâ€™s easier to send and recognize users with? user_id or email?
Do I need to set an async await on the user data before sending to the backend?
If I use user_id, does is stay the same and therefore can be used to authorize or do I need to use email for that? 
Is it easier to match email address from frontend with backend and if matching, allow them to see the data? 

First:
On login, send email address to backend
If email address matches any in backend, send back data, if not, nothing
