Backend for: https://github.com/willwearing/finance<br>
Got to building tables using KNEX.<br> 
Need to read this first: https://auth0.com/blog/complete-guide-to-nodejs-express-user-authentication/<br>
Can then understand what tables need to look like. I can build them using: https://app.dbdesigner.net/designer<br>
