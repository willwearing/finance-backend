To do:
Build ListStockCards component to display stock ticker search history
Add marketing pages
Add Nav bar - https://github.com/willwearing/react-nav-bar
Style whole site

Research:
Stock purchase API - can this be done from auth0 user data or do I need to just redirect them to another site 

Future:
